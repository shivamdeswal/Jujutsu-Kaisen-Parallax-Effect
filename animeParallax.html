                Jujutsu Kaisen is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 2018, with its chapters collected and published in 23 tankōbon volumes as of July 2023. <br> <br>
                Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted teenager, joins his school's Occult Club for fun, but discovers that its members are actual sorcerers who can manipulate the energy between beings for their own use. He hears about a cursed talisman - the finger of Sukuna, a demon - and its being targeted by other cursed beings.

                Suguru Geto (夏げ油とう傑すぐる Getō Suguru?) is an antagonist in both the Jujutsu Kaisen series and its prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Jujutsu High. He was originally a student of Masamichi Yaga's alongside Satoru Gojo and Shoko Ieiri at Tokyo Jujutsu High. <br> <br>
                His experiences as a jujutsu sorcerer bred a deep hatred for non-sorcerers, leading to an incident where Suguru massacred over a hundred civilians in a single night. He was expelled from Jujutsu High and came to be known as the worst of all curse users.
